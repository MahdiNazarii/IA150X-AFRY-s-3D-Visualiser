# IA150X AFRYs 3D Visualiser

This project is a thesis project for our bachelor's degree (Course IA150X), which involves developing a prototype 3D visualizer using Unity to depict mining machinery provided by AFRY in Nynäshamn. The following video shows the result of the project side by side with AFRY's current 2D visualizer. The view in the video is split into top and bottom, with AFRY’s 2D visualizer at the top and the developed 3D visualizer at the bottom.
